# Overview
<!-- What is the need or opportunity your work will address? What current approaches/methods are used, and how are these current approaches limited/insufficient?  -->
Statistical graphics and other scientific images are incredibly powerful and efficient ways to convey numerical information in a way that humans can use for decision making. However, research on visual perception of statistical graphics and other data visualizations is a patchwork of inconsistent methods, and most recommendations are based primarily on experience rather than empirical study.

<!-- In the context of the need for your work described above, what is your long-term career goal in terms of both research and education?  -->
Over the course of my career, I want to leverage research in statistical graphics and data visualization to *help humans and algorithms work together more efficiently and effectively*. 
<!-- I will teach my students to enjoy working with data, to program with data in mind, to give back to the community by publishing open-source tools for reproducible science, and to think about the audience when they create statistical analyses and visualizations. I will bring these focuses to my research as well, conducting experiments which are designed to understand how humans read charts, interact with data, and draw conclusions from statistical graphics, and using this newfound understanding of human perception to enrich statistical modeling and machine learning algorithms by engineering features designed to mimic human perception in a repeatable and reproducible way. -->

<!-- Toward that long-term goal, what is the overall research goal of the five-year CAREER program? What are the research objectives that will be completed in pursuit of this goal?  -->
My **research goal** is to understand how we use and perceive charts, and how the design of statistical graphics impacts our ability to use them successfully. To address this goal, I will (1) develop multimodal methods for testing statistical graphics in order to examine how the same chart might be used in different judgment tasks, such as comparison, prediction, and estimation, and (2) apply these methods to assess the decisions scientists make when creating statistical graphics for exploration or communication of results. I will apply these findings to (3) develop new statistical features that mimic human perception in tasks which are currently conducted through human visual comparison, such as forensic pattern evidence, developing statistically validated, empirical tools to assist scientists with reproducible decision-making.

<!-- What is the overall education goal of the five-year CAREER program? What are the education objectives that will be completed in pursuit of this goal?  -->
My **teaching goal** is to develop tools and curricula to support statistical learning and scientific decision making in undergraduate, graduate, and legal contexts. To address this goal, I will (1) develop experiential learning activities in statistical graphics for intro statistics courses, (2) integrate tools for reproducible science and open-source software into statistical programming courses, and (3) work with forensic scientists, lawyers, and judges to discuss scientific and statistical validity, assess the support for different forensic evidence evaluation techniques, and promote the importance of open, reproducible science in forensics and the legal system. 

# Intellectual Merit
<!-- Describe the potential of the proposed activity to advance knowledge. What is novel in the proposed approach? What knowledge will be advanced, and how will this new knowledge inform future work in your field and other fields? -->
I will produce and validate a set of experimental methods for conducting graphical user studies, laying a foundation for future work in this area. 
The studies we conduct while developing and validating these tools will examine fundamental questions in statistical graphics design, advancing scientists' ability to communicate results with each other and the general public, and producing new avenues for research in information visualization, perception, and statistical graphics. 
We will also investigate the effects of expertise, neurodivergence, and disability on graphical perception, expanding this research to under-studied populations.
The experiential learning project will provide new information about the design of intro stats courses, increasing student engagement and making undergrads less averse to STEM. 

# Broader Impacts
<!-- Describe the potential of the proposed activity to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes. How might results of this work ultimately inform applications that benefit society?  -->
The educational objectives will produce students who are more engaged in STEM coursework (undergrad), who understand the importance of reproducible science and implement best practices for reproducibility in their own research (grad), who contribute to the open-source community (undergrad, grad), and who understand the importance of ongoing engagement between scientists and society, with particular focus on the legal/justice system. 
The information we accumulate on perception of graphics will inform the development of open-source, explainable algorithms to replicate human perception of forensic data; these algorithms will provide additional tools to the forensic science community and result in better use of forensic evidence within the legal system. In addition, the interactions we have with judges, lawyers, and forensic scientists will promote the importance of good statistics and experimental design when evaluating new techniques in forensic science.
