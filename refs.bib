	abstract = {Graphs have become a fixture of everyday life, used in scientific and business publications, in magazines and newspapers, on television, on billboards, and even on cereal boxes. Nonetheless, surprisingly few graphs communicate effectively, and most graphs fail because they do not take into account the goals, needs, and abilities of the viewers. In Graph Design for Eye and Mind, Stephen Kosslyn addresses these problems by presenting eight psychological principles for constructing effective graphs. Each principle is solidly rooted both in the scientific literature on how we perceive and comprehend graphs and in general facts about how our eyes and brains process visual information. Kosslyn then uses these eight psychological principles as the basis for hundreds of specific recommendations that serve as a concrete, step-by-step guide to deciding whether a graph is an appropriate display to use, choosing the correct type of graph for a specific type of data and message, and then constructing graphs that will be understood at a glance. Kosslyn also includes a complete review of the scientific literature on graph perception and comprehension, and appendices that provide a quick tutorial on basic statistics and a checklist for evaluating computer-graphics programs. Graph Design for Eye and Mind is an invaluable reference for anyone who uses visual displays to convey information in the sciences, humanities, and businesses such as finance, marketing, and advertising.},

We believe that this small set of guidelines based on a review of key visualization literature can help researchers improve the communication of their results using effective visualization.

In the context of visualization, several different types of measures have been proposed, ranging from approaches that evaluate particular aspects of visualization techniques, their perceptual characteristics, and even economic factors. Furthermore, there are approaches that attempt to provide means for measuring general properties of the visualization process as a whole. Measures can be quantitative or qualitative, and one of the primary goals is to provide objective means for reasoning about visualizations and their effectiveness. As such, they play a central role in the development of scientific theories for visualization. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the current state of the art, survey and classify different types of visualization measures, characterize their strengths and drawbacks, and provide an outline of open challenges for future research.},

The results showed that children with dyslexia, dyscalculia and comorbidity exhibited common deficits in numerosity processing and visual perception. Furthermore, visual perception deficits accounted for deficits in numerosity processing in all three groups. The results suggest that visual perception deficits are a common cognitive deficit underlying both developmental dyslexia and dyscalculia.},

We characterize observed strategies and tools for performing these activities, as well as major challenges that hinder designers' current workflows. In addition, we identify themes that cut across these two activities: criteria for determining example usefulness, curation practices, and design fixation. Given our findings, we discuss the implications for visualization design and authoring tools and highlight critical areas for future research.},

  abstract = {Visual selective attention refers to the selection of relevant visual elements in a scene whilst ignoring irrelevant visual elements. Visual Selective Attention Dysfunctions (VSAD) are prevalent in children with Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and Dyslexia. An important issue in the pediatric neuropsychological practice is how to discriminate between the task performance of these populations. We conducted a scoping review of the literature on visual search performance (VSP) in children with CVI, ADHD, and Dyslexia, aged 6\textendash 12 years. After a systematic selection process, 35 studies were included. Results suggest that all patient groups have some degree of impaired VSP compared to typically developing children. Children with CVI tend to react slower and less accurately. VSP impairments in children with ADHD are characterized by poor accuracy rather than reaction time. Children with Dyslexia tend to be slower and less accurate, depending on stimulus type. Besides VSAD, it is argued that other neurocognitive mechanisms might influence VSP, such as speed-accuracy trade-off or an executive functioning deficit in ADHD and a phonological deficit in Dyslexia. This paper further discusses the differences and similarities in visual search performance between the groups. The sparse data in children with an official diagnosis of CVI and the technical inconclusive data on children with ADHD and Dyslexia demonstrate complexity of discriminating between these populations in clinical practice based on VSP. New and more quantitative VSP parameters, such as eye tracking-based measures, may contribute to a refined classification among CVI, ADHD, and Dyslexia.},

In contrast with previous results, considerable individual differences with respect to sensitivity for rate of growth were observed.

Extrapolation of descending series is much easier, and may therefore better discriminate among subjects.},

In 2015, the New York Times introduced an interactive feature, called ``You Draw It,'' where readers were asked to input their own assumptions about various metrics and compare how these assumptions relate to reality. In this article, we validate ``You Draw It'' as a method for graphical testing, comparing results to the less technological method used in Mosteller et al. and extending that study with formal statistical analysis methods. Results were consistent with those found in the previous study; when shown points following a linear trend, participants tended to fit the slope of the principal axis over the slope of the least-squares regression line. This trend was most prominent when shown data simulated with larger variances. This study reinforces the differences between intuitive visual model fitting and statistical model fitting, providing information about human perception as it relates to the use of statistical graphics.

But we also need to take “flaws” of the human perceptual system into account. The sine illusion provides an example where human perception leads to systematic bias in the assessment of the optical stimulus, with a particularly notable impact on perception of time-series data with a seasonal component. In this article, we discuss the reasons for the illusion and various strategies useful to break the illusion or reduce its strength. We demonstrate the presence of the illusion in real-world and theoretical situations. We also present data from a user study, which demonstrate the dramatic effect the sine illusion can have on conclusions drawn from displayed data.},

Yet, in literature a broad set factors are discussed for effective visualization design. In this paper, we analyzed principles and guidelines extracted from academic papers, books, and blogs and examined factors that influence visualization design to aid the design of automated visualization systems. We used grounded theory to code and examine concepts and relationships extracted. We found a variety factors, including domain, semantics, user tasks, insight, and display characteristics and found a variety of interactions between these factors including causal, contextual, and logical relationships. Our findings suggest that automatic approaches need to handle not only broader set of factors but also complex interactions among them. Furthermore, several factors such as domain and semantics are likely to gain even more importance, necessitating flexibility in terms the specification of design know-how as input to automatic visual analytics systems.},

(Radiology 242:396\textendash 402, 2007). Eye movement and performance data were cumulated from 819 experts, 187 intermediates, and 893 novices. In support of the evaluated theories, experts, when compared with non-experts, had shorter fixation durations, more fixations on task-relevant areas, and fewer fixations on task-redundant areas; experts also had longer saccades and shorter times to first fixate relevant information, owing to superiority in parafoveal processing and selective attention allocation. Eye movements, reaction time, and performance accuracy were moderated by characteristics of visualization (dynamics, realism, dimensionality, modality, and text annotation), task (complexity, time-on-task, and task control), and domain (sports, medicine, transportation, other). These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for theories of visual expertise in professional domains and their significance for the design of learning environments.},

To assess graphic effectiveness, eye tracking methods can help provide a deeper understanding of scanning strategies that underlie more traditional, high-level accuracy and task completion time results. Eye tracking methods entail many challenges, such as defining fixations, assigning fixations to areas of interest, choosing appropriate metrics, addressing potential errors in gaze location, and handling scanning interruptions. Special considerations are also required designing, preparing, and conducting eye tracking studies. An illustrative eye tracking study was conducted to assess the differences in scanning within and between bar, line, and spider graphs, to determine which graphs best support relative comparisons along several dimensions. There was excessive scanning to locate the correct bar graph in easier tasks. Scanning across bar and line graph dimensions before comparing across graphs was evident in harder tasks. There was repeated scanning between the same dimension of two spider graphs, implying a greater cognitive demand from scanning in a circle that contains multiple linear dimensions, than from scanning the linear axes of bar and line graphs. With appropriate task design and targeted analysis metrics, eye tracking techniques can illuminate visual scanning patterns hidden by more traditional time and accuracy results.},

By comparing subjects' verbalizations with their eye movements, we found stimulated RTA to be valid and reliable: the method provides a valid account of what people attended to in completing tasks, it has a low risk of introducing fabrications, and its validity is unaffected by task complexity. More detailed analysis of RTA shows that it also provides additional information about user's inferences and strategies in completing tasks. The findings of this study provide valuable support for usability practitioners to use RTA and to trust the users' performance information collected by this method in a usability study.},

We investigated how graph types (line, vertical bar, and horizontal bar graphs), graphic patterns (single and double graphic patterns), and question types (point locating and comparison questions) differentially affect graph comprehension of students with and without dyslexia. Groups were compared for (1) reaction times for answering comprehension questions based on graphed data and (2) eye gaze times for specific graph subregions (x-axis, y-axis, pattern, legend, question, and answer). Dyslexic readers were significantly slower in their graph comprehension than their peers with group differences becoming more robust with the increasing complexity of graphs and tasks. In addition, dyslexic readers' initial eye gaze viewing times for linguistic subregions (question and answer) and total viewing times for both linguistic (question and answer) and nonlinguistic (pattern) subregions were significantly longer than their control peers' times. In spite of using elementary-level paragraphs for comprehension and simple graph forms, young adults with dyslexia needed more time to process linguistic and nonlinguistic stimuli. These findings are discussed relative to theories proposed to address fundamental processing deficits in individuals with dyslexia.},

  abstract = {We investigate task performance and reading characteristics for scatterplots (Cartesian coordinates) and parallel coordinates. In a controlled eye-tracking study, we asked 24 participants to assess the relative distance of points in multidimensional space, depending on the diagram type (parallel coordinates or a horizontal collection of scatterplots), the number of data dimensions (2, 4, 6, or 8), and the relative distance between points (15\%, 20\%, or 25\%). For a given reference point and two target points, we instructed participants to choose the target point that was closer to the reference point in multidimensional space. We present a visual scanning model that describes different strategies to solve this retrieval task for both diagram types, and propose corresponding hypotheses that we test using task completion time, accuracy, and gaze positions as dependent variables. Our results show that scatterplots outperform parallel coordinates significantly in 2 dimensions, however, the task was solved more quickly and more accurately with parallel coordinates in 8 dimensions. The eye-tracking data further shows significant differences between Cartesian and parallel coordinates, as well as between different numbers of dimensions. For parallel coordinates, there is a clear trend toward shorter fixations and longer saccades with increasing number of dimensions. Using an area-of-interest (AOI) based approach, we identify different reading strategies for each diagram type: For parallel coordinates, the participants' gaze frequently jumped back and forth between pairs of axes, while axes were rarely focused on when viewing Cartesian coordinates. We further found that participants' attention is biased: toward the center of the whole plot for parallel coordinates and skewed to the center/left side for Cartesian coordinates. We anticipate that these results may support the design of more effective visualizations for multidimensional data.},

As a statistician, it is very useful to know how analysts make decisions based on plots, so that the plots can be improved for better performance. With the help of eye-tracking equipment, researchers can assess this. This paper describes the use of an eye-tracker for assessing how people look at lineup plots that are used in visual inference. The experiment included a comparison of several plot types, histogram, density, scatterplot and dotplot for two group data, and the use of side-by-side boxplots and scatterplots for assessing the importance of predictors in a regression model. Results are compared with those from a larger visual inference study using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The eye-tracker can be manageably used only on a small sample of people, to give detailed information plot about reading behavior, so it is ideally used prior to a large human subjects study to help refine the experimental procedures, or as a post-processing step to better understand any surprises in the results.}

Two problems are raised by this goal: The codification of graphic design criteria in a form that can be used by the presentation tool, and the generation of a wide variety of designs so that the presentation tool can accommodate a wide variety of information. The approach described in this paper is based on the view that graphical presentations are sentences of graphical languages. The graphic design issues are codified as expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for graphical languages. Expressiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language can express the desired information. Effectiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language exploits the capabilities of the output medium and the human visual system. A wide variety of designs can be systematically generated by using a composition algebra that composes a small set of primitive graphical languages. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to implement a prototype presentation tool called {APT} (A Presentation Tool), which is based on the composition algebra and the graphic design criteria.},

Our findings quantitatively support many conventional qualitative design guidelines, including that (1) titles and supporting text should convey the message of a visualization, (2) if used appropriately, pictograms do not interfere with understanding and can improve recognition, and (3) redundancy helps effectively communicate the message. Importantly, we show that visualizations memorable “at-a-glance” are also capable of effectively conveying the message of the visualization.

In Experiment 1, the data-ink ratios of bar and line graphs affected the accuracy and response times for comparison, difference, and mean questions: the higher the data-ink ratio, the faster the response time and the greater the accuracy. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that the effects of ink in the syntactic elements of a graph depend on the location and function of the element: redundant ink in the indicators had limited effects on performance, pictorial backgrounds generally increased response time and decreased accuracy, y axis tick marks generally increased response time, and the y axis line and the x axis generally decreased response time. The effect of each graphical element was conditional on the type of graph and task and the presence of other graphical elements. The discussion focuses on psychological principles that may underlie the effects of each syntactic element.},

  abstract = {Data visualization design has a powerful effect on which patterns we see as salient and how quickly we see them. The visualization practitioner community prescribes two popular guidelines for creating clear and efficient visualizations: declutter and focus. The declutter guidelines suggest removing non-critical gridlines, excessive labeling of data values, and color variability to improve aesthetics and to maximize the emphasis on the data relative to the design itself. The focus guidelines for explanatory communication recommend including a clear headline that describes the relevant data pattern, highlighting a subset of relevant data values with a unique color, and connecting those values to written annotations that contextualize them in a broader argument. We evaluated how these recommendations impact recall of the depicted information across cluttered, decluttered, and decluttered+focused designs of six graph topics. Undergraduate students were asked to redraw previously seen visualizations, to recall their topics and main conclusions, and to rate the varied designs on aesthetics, clarity, professionalism, and trustworthiness. Decluttering designs led to higher ratings on professionalism, and adding focus to the design led to higher ratings on aesthetics and clarity. They also showed better memory for the highlighted pattern in the data, as reflected across redrawings of the original visualization and typed free-response conclusions, though we do not know whether these results would generalize beyond our memory-based tasks. The results largely empirically validate the intuitions of visualization designers and practitioners.

Focusing on the presentation of data per se can result in situations where these higher goals are ignored. This is especially the case for situations where cognitive or perceptual biases make the presentation of ``just'' the data as misleading as willful distortion. We argue that we need to de-sanctify data, and occasionally promote designs which distort or obscure data in service of understanding. We discuss examples of beneficial embellishment, distortion, and obfuscation in visualization, and argue that these examples are representative of a wider class of techniques for going beyond simplistic presentations of data.},

  abstract = {Rounding is a common phenomenon when subjects provide an answer to an open-ended question, both in experimental tasks and in survey responses. From a statistical perspective, rounding implies that the measured variable is a coarsened version of the underlying continuous target variable. Since the coarsening process is non-random, inference from rounded data is generally biased. Despite the potentially severe consequences of rounding, little is known about its causes. In this paper, we focus on subjects' uncertainty about the target variable as one potential cause for rounding behavior. We present a novel experimental method that induces uncertainty in a controlled way, thus providing causal evidence for the effect of subjects' uncertainty on the extent of rounding. Then, we specify and estimate a mixture model that relates uncertainty and rounding. The results suggest that an increase in the exogenous level of uncertainty translates into higher variance of the subjects' beliefs, which in turn results in more rounding.},

The experiment included a variety of additional comparisons including the presence or absence of numeric feedback in theVAS, the use of a midpoint or no midpoint for the other two versions, and numbered versus unnumbered radio button scales. The response distributions for theVAS did not differ from those using the other scale types, and theVAS had higher rates of missing data and longer completion times.},

Slider scales negatively affect response rate (especially on mobile devices), the sample composition, the distribution of values, and also increase response times. VAS and radio buttons, however, can be used without negative side effects, even on touch screen devices like smartphones. Overall, it is recommended to avoid slider scales. As small differences in rating scales\textemdash here drag and drop versus point and click\textemdash have a huge influence on data collection, an optimal implementation of VAS is suggested. However, measurement of discrete variables with a moderate number of response options should be done with radio buttons scales unless a small screen size\textemdash for example, on smartphones\textemdash requires an economical use of space.},

  abstract = {Web surveys have expanded the set of options available to questionnaire designers. One new option is to make it possible to administer questions that respondents can answer by moving an on-screen slider to the position on a visual scale that best reflects their position on an underlying dimension. One attribute of sliders that is not well understood is how the position of the slider when the question is presented can affect responses?for better or worse. Yet the slider?s default position is under the control of the designer and can potentially be exploited to maximize the quality of the responses (e.g., positioning the slider by default at the midpoint on the assumption that this is unbiased). There are several studies in the methodology literature~that compare data collected via sliders and other methods, but relatively little attention has been given to the issue of default slider values. The current article reports findings from four web survey experiments (n = 3,744, 490, 697, and 902) that examine whether and how the default values of the slider influence responses. For 101-point questions (e.g., feeling thermometers), when the slider default values are set to be 25, 50, 75, or 100, significantly more respondents choose those values as their answers which seems unlikely to accurately reflect respondents? actual position on the underlying dimension. For 21- and 7-point scales, there is no significant or consistent impact of the default slider value on answers. The completion times are also similar across default values for questions with scales of this type. When sliders do not appear by default at any value, that is, the respondent must click or touch the scale to activate the slider, the missing data rate is low for 21- and 7-point scales but higher for the 101-point scales. Respondents? evaluation of the survey difficulty and their satisfaction level with the survey do not differ by the default values. The implications and limitations of the findings are discussed.},

When people use text boxes to make payments, they evaluate monetary values relative to the starting point of the response range. In contrast, when people use slider scales, they evaluate monetary values relative to the starting point as well as the end point of the response range. Consequently, payments elicited on slider scales tend to be assimilated toward the end point of the response range. This slider scale end point assimilation effect varies for ascending and descending payment formats. For ascending payment formats (e.g., eBay bids), slider scales elicit higher payments than text boxes. But for descending payment formats (e.g., Priceline bids), slider scales elicit lower payments than text boxes. This research not only documents how slider scales alter consumer payments, but also explains how the mental number line affects financial decisions.},

Distracting elements like decorative "chartjunk" or extraneous information are avoided so as not to slow comprehension. Yet several recent studies in visualization research provide evidence that non-efficient visual elements may benefit comprehension and recall on the part of users. Similarly, findings from studies related to learning from visual displays in various subfields of psychology suggest that introducing cognitive difficulties to visualization interaction can improve a user's understanding of important information. In this paper, we synthesize empirical results from cross-disciplinary research on visual information representations, providing a counterpoint to efficiency-based design theory with guidelines that describe how visual difficulties can be introduced to benefit comprehension and recall. We identify conditions under which the application of visual difficulties is appropriate based on underlying factors in visualization interaction like active processing and engagement. We characterize effective graph design as a trade-off between efficiency and learning difficulties in order to provide Information Visualization (InfoVis) researchers and practitioners with a framework for organizing explorations of graphs for which comprehension and recall are crucial. We identify implications of this view for the design and evaluation of information visualizations.},

Our seven scenarios, evaluating visual data analysis and reasoning, evaluating user performance, evaluating user experience, evaluating environments and work practices, evaluating communication through visualization, evaluating visualization algorithms, and evaluating collaborative data analysis were derived through an extensive literature review of over 800 visualization publications. These scenarios distinguish different study goals and types of research questions and are illustrated through example studies. Through this broad survey and the distillation of these scenarios, we make two contributions. One, we encapsulate the current practices in the information visualization research community and, two, we provide a different approach to reaching decisions about what might be the most effective evaluation of a given information visualization. Scenarios can be used to choose appropriate research questions and goals and the provided examples can be consulted for guidance on how to design one's own study.},

However, it is often difficult to visually differentiate graphical elements encoding a small difference in value, such as the heights of similar bars in bar chart or angles of similar sections in pie chart. Perceptual laws can be used in order to model when and how we perceive this difference. In this work, we model the perception of Just Noticeable Differences (JNDs), the minimum difference in visual attributes that allow faithfully comparing similar elements, in charts. Specifically, we explore the relation between JNDs and two major visual variables: the intensity of visual elements and the distance between them, and study it in three charts: bar chart, pie chart and bubble chart. Through an empirical study, we identify main effects on JND for distance in bar charts, intensity in pie charts, and both distance and intensity in bubble charts. By fitting a linear mixed effects model, we model JND and find that JND grows as the exponential function of variables. We highlight several usage scenarios that make use of the JND modeling in which elements below the fitted JND are detected and enhanced with secondary visual cues for better discrimination.},

  abstract = {We present a rigorous way to evaluate the visual perception of correlation in scatterplots, based on classical psychophysical methods originally developed for simple properties such as brightness. Although scatterplots are graphically complex, the quantity they convey is relatively simple. As such, it may be possible to assess the perception of correlation in a similar way. Scatterplots were each of 5.0\textdegree{} extent, containing 100 points with a bivariate normal distribution. Means were 0.5 of the range of the points, and standard deviations 0.2 of this range. Precision was determined via an adaptive algorithm to find the just noticeable differences (jnds) in correlation, i.e., the difference between two side-by-side scatterplots that could be discriminated 75\% of the time. Accuracy was measured by direct estimation, using reference scatterplots with fixed upper and lower values, with a test scatterplot adjusted so that its correlation appeared to be halfway between these. This process was recursively applied to yield several further estimates. Results of the discrimination tests show jnd(r) = k (1/b \textendash{} r), where r is the Pearson correlation, and parameters 0 {$<$} k, b {$<$} 1. Integration yields a subjective estimate of correlation g(r) = ln(1 \textendash{} br) / ln(1 \textendash{} b). The values of b found via discrimination closely match those found via direct estimation. As such, it appears that the perception of correlation in a scatterplot is completely described by two related performance curves, specified by two easily-measured parameters.},

There has been little work done to investigate the validity and reliability of RTA. This paper reports on an experiment investigating these issues using the method called stimulated RTA. By comparing subjects' verbalizations with their eye movements, we found stimulated RTA to be valid and reliable: the method provides a valid account of what people attended to in completing tasks, it has a low risk of introducing fabrications, and its validity is unaffected by task complexity. More detailed analysis of RTA shows that it also provides additional information about user's inferences and strategies in completing tasks. The findings of this study provide valuable support for usability practitioners to use RTA and to trust the users' performance information collected by this method in a usability study.},

  abstract = {In statistical modeling, we strive to specify models that resemble data collected in studies or observed from processes. Consequently, distributional specification and parameter estimation are central to parametric models. Graphical procedures, such as the quantile\textendash quantile (Q\textendash Q) plot, are arguably the most widely used method of distributional assessment, though critics find their interpretation to be overly subjective. Formal goodness of fit tests are available and are quite powerful, but only indicate whether there is a lack of fit, not why there is lack of fit. In this article, we explore the use of the lineup protocol to inject rigor into graphical distributional assessment and compare its power to that of formal distributional tests. We find that lineup tests are considerably more powerful than traditional tests of normality. A further investigation into the design of Q\textendash Q plots shows that de-trended Q\textendash Q plots are more powerful than the standard approach as long as the plot preserves distances in x and y to be the same. While we focus on diagnosing nonnormality, our approach is general and can be directly extended to the assessment of other distributions.},

As a statistician, it is very useful to know how analysts make decisions based on plots, so that the plots can be improved for better performance. With the help of eye-tracking equipment, researchers can assess this. This paper describes the use of an eye-tracker for assessing how people look at lineup plots that are used in visual inference. The experiment included a comparison of several plot types, histogram, density, scatterplot and dotplot for two group data, and the use of side-by-side boxplots and scatterplots for assessing the importance of predictors in a regression model. Results are compared with those from a larger visual inference study using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The eye-tracker can be manageably used only on a small sample of people, to give detailed information plot about reading behavior, so it is ideally used prior to a large human subjects study to help refine the experimental procedures, or as a post-processing step to better understand any surprises in the results.},

But design philosophies that emphasize exploration over other phases of analysis risk confusing a need for flexibility with a conclusion that exploratory visual analysis is inherently ``model free'' and cannot be formalized. We describe how without a grounding in theories of human statistical inference, research in exploratory visual analysis can lead to contradictory interface objectives and representations of uncertainty that can discourage users from drawing valid inferences. We discuss how the concept of a model check in a Bayesian statistical framework unites exploratory and confirmatory analysis, and how this understanding relates to other proposed theories of graphical inference. Viewing interactive analysis as driven by model checks suggests new directions for software and empirical research around exploratory and visual analysis. For example, systems might enable specifying and explicitly comparing data to null and other reference distributions and better representations of uncertainty. Implications of Bayesian and other theories of graphical inference can be tested against outcomes of interactive analysis by people to drive theory development.},

In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a "phoneme." Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0\% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.},

Besides, sentiment analysis techniques are applied to video, audio and transcribed text content to obtain insights on the user experience of participants. The main motivations to develop UXmood are to support joint analysis of usability and user experience, to use sentiment analysis for supporting qualitative analysis, to synchronize different types of data in the same dashboard and to allow the analysis of user interactions from any device with a web browser.

  abstract = {When presenting visualizations of experimental results, scientists often choose to display either inferential uncertainty (e.g., uncertainty in the estimate of a population mean) or outcome uncertainty (e.g., variation of outcomes around that mean) about their estimates. How does this choice impact readers' beliefs about the size of treatment effects? We investigate this question in two experiments comparing 95\% confidence intervals (means and standard errors) to 95\% prediction intervals (means and standard deviations). The first experiment finds that participants are willing to pay more for and overestimate the effect of a treatment when shown confidence intervals relative to prediction intervals. The second experiment evaluates how alternative visualizations compare to standard visualizations for different effect sizes. We find that axis rescaling reduces error, but not as well as prediction intervals or animated hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs), and that depicting inferential uncertainty causes participants to underestimate variability in individual outcomes.},

  abstract = {Understanding and accounting for uncertainty is critical to effectively reasoning about visualized data. However, evaluating the impact of an uncertainty visualization is complex due to the difficulties that people have interpreting uncertainty and the challenge of defining correct behavior with uncertainty information. Currently, evaluators of uncertainty visualization must rely on general purpose visualization evaluation frameworks which can be ill-equipped to provide guidance with the unique difficulties of assessing judgments under uncertainty. To help evaluators navigate these complexities, we present a taxonomy for characterizing decisions made in designing an evaluation of an uncertainty visualization. Our taxonomy differentiates six levels of decisions that comprise an uncertainty visualization evaluation: the behavioral targets of the study, expected effects from an uncertainty visualization, evaluation goals, measures, elicitation techniques, and analysis approaches. Applying our taxonomy to 86 user studies of uncertainty visualizations, we find that existing evaluation practice, particularly in visualization research, focuses on Performance and Satisfaction-based measures that assume more predictable and statistically-driven judgment behavior than is suggested by research on human judgment and decision making. We reflect on common themes in evaluation practice concerning the interpretation and semantics of uncertainty, the use of confidence reporting, and a bias toward evaluating performance as accuracy rather than decision quality. We conclude with a concrete set of recommendations for evaluators designed to reduce the mismatch between the conceptualization of uncertainty in visualization versus other fields.},

  abstract = {Undergraduate research and inquiry is a growing movement within the teaching and learning nexus, with many institutions developing their practices within this culture of education. This study aimed to identify the perceptions and experiences surrounding undergraduate research and inquiry among students and faculty at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada; assess the extent of research and inquiry in the design of undergraduate courses; and explore the facilitators and obstacles educators encounter when attempting to implement this educational approach. Although differences exist in student and faculty definitions of undergraduate research and inquiry, we found two principal models that characterize its structure and delivery\textemdash the scaffold model and bookend model. A third, the abstract model, does not employ the practice of inquiry. Despite numerous benefits unique to undergraduate research and inquiry education identified by stakeholders, notable barriers (such as funding, faculty buy-in, limited student experience, and inherent competition) hinder its progress. Overall, we found a diversity of undergraduate research and inquiry practices across the university, operating within varying cultures and comfort levels, which suggests unequal access for student learners.},
