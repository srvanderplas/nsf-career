Multiple students - need to have separate pieces for each person. For instance, have them each come up with a data scenario and test things out.


High schooler vs. REU
- HS is more work, but is much cheaper
- Next summer will be $12/h and 2025 $15/h and will be stable there. REU stipend is $6k + housing (10-11k). Ucare is another option for university funding.
- REU is handled by grad studies. All you have to do is contact Casey Coleman and they handle the advertising, etc., program management, all sorts of things.


- Field trips, JA Woolam, ...
